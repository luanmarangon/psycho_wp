== Description ==



[AdOpt’s Cookie Banner plugin](https://goadopt.io) is part of a Consent Management Platform that will help you in making all your websites LGPD, CCPA, GDPR (RGPD, DSVGO), PIPEDA, CINIL of France and many other regulations compliant.

This is the best plugin for WordPress websites compliance!

A [CMP – Consent Management Platform](https://goadopt.io) , helps companies to comply with privacy regulations using technology that manages these consents for each visitor who accesses their websites.


For the end user, any website visitors, we are a “Cookie Banner”, for companies, a whole ecosystem that organizes the implementation of Consent as a Legal Basis.

AdOpt’s technology recognizes each visitor and interacts with them through the cookie notice. If it is a new visitor, it then asks for permission to use the cookies installed on the website. Once authorized, AdOpt records that consent and releases the cookies upon approval.

If the visitor returns at another time the consent is acknowledged, not asked again. Or, it can also be updated/revoked if the visitor so chooses, always freely.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why should I use AdOpt ? =
AdOpt is the best option for websites that use cookies and have chosen Consent as the Legal Basis to support the collection of personal data.
Our system, planned within the concepts of Privacy by Design, transparently informs your website users what data is collected and manages all updated consents as required by GDPR, LGPD and CCPA, etc. This ensures that you stay safe and creates a trusting relationship with your users.

= Does my website need a cookie notice ? =
If you collect personal data, use cookies for marketing and analytics through pixels on your website, and have chosen Consent as the Legal Basis for your company, the cookie notice will help you a lot!

For, the regulations like GDPR, LGPD or CCPA, and many others, requires users to be notified about what data you collect, including third-party cookies.
Their processing will only be valid after consent has been freely and explicitly obtained from the data subject. In addition, it is the responsibility of the company to prove "in writing" that consent has been given. All of these are tasks performed by a cookie management platform, AdOpt!

= Why not using those banners with: By continuing to browse, you agree to the use of cookies... ? =
Because the law requires that consent must be "free and stated," not "implied," or "subjective."
In addition, a good cookie notice should also allow the visitor to easily and freely choose their options, without any bias of consent. Be careful with notices that use scroll as consent!


= Will I be fully complied for LGPD, GDPR and CCPA using AdOpt ? =
No, a Consent Management Platform like AdOpt does not cover all sides of the regulation. AdOpt operates on the first hypothesis of personal data processing which is consent (art, 7, I - LGPD, e.g.).
Each company has its own processes, so you must also observe the flow of data within your company in relation to the other obligations of the law, and even other legal basis that may supplement the consent.
This is one of the responsibilities of the Data Protection Officer of your company, discuss this point with him/her!,
However, since consent is very popular in the market for companies with a digital presence, it would already be an excellent start on the road to compliance.

= Do I need a developer to configure AdOpt ? =
Well, it...depends!

A regular installation flow would be, to paste a code (tag) into your website's header. But, for WP users, our plugin makes this for you.
So, you only need to insert the AdOpt BannerID Key, and it is already installed. Besides, rest assured that we have a support team that will help you if you need it, and as soon as you create an account, you will receive a complete tutorial!
feel free to chat with us, or send any doubt to hey@goadopt.io.
